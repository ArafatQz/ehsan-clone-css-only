## 💪 Strengths of CSS-Only Development

- **Performance & Size**  
    - Zero runtime dependencies: no bulky frameworks or JavaScript libraries to download  
    - Faster initial load and reduced bandwidth usage  
- **Simplicity & Maintainability**  
    - Clear separation of concerns: styles in one file, markup in another  
    - Easy to debug visual issues in the browser’s inspector without stepping through JS  
- **Progressive Enhancement**  
    - Base experience works even if JS is disabled or fails to load  
    - CSS transitions and animations degrade gracefully  
- **Browser Compatibility**  
    - Leveraging well-supported CSS3 features ensures consistent behavior across modern browsers

## ⚔️ The Challenges

- **Complex Interactions**  
    - Pure CSS carousels and dropdowns rely on hacks (`checkbox`/`radio` toggles, `:target`), which can become hard to manage at scale  
- **Maintainability for Large Projects**  
    - Pure-CSS solutions can introduce specificity wars and deeply nested selectors, making refactoring more error-prone
